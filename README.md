# meta-repo

A Claude Code skill that scaffolds and operates **multi-subrepo workspaces with an autonomous harness** — a pattern where one parent workspace (npm, pnpm, or yarn at the root) wraps N independent git repositories as sub-folders. The workspace root provides cross-cutting tooling (dev, status, doctor, branch ops, parallel PR push), **parallel git worktrees**, a **file-based ticket queue**, and a **governor** that drives headless `claude -p` workers to grind that backlog semi-autonomously. Each sub-repo keeps its own remote, PR queue, and CI.

## How it works

The defining trait is **thin-driver orchestration**: whatever sits in the driver's seat holds almost no context, and every real unit of work runs in a *fresh, bounded, throwaway* child session. The governor makes this literal — a pure-bash driver spawns one headless `claude -p` worker per ticket; the worker does the job in its own context window and its own worktree, writes a small JSON report to a file, then dies. The driver reads the **report**, never the worker's transcript — so its footprint is identical whether it grinds 1 ticket or 1,000. (A long *interactive* session that does all the work inline is the opposite: its context only grows, and every turn re-pays for it.)

                                    worker's transcript → driver stays thin

       Same principle, interactive: a session delegates heavy work to a
       child agent and keeps only the verdict — never reading big files or
       running verbose builds in the driver itself ("router posture").
```

## When this pattern fits

You have multiple services that ship on independent cadences (e.g., `backend/`, `console/`, `website/`), but you want to operate them as one product — share product context with AI agents, run parallel work without merge conflicts, and let a session work a backlog for long stretches without stopping for permission.

## When it doesn't

- All services deploy together → use Turborepo or a single repo
- Sub-repos share a lot of code daily → N git remotes make code sharing painful
- You're early enough that the abstraction cost outweighs deploy-independence

## Install

```bash
git clone <this-repo> ~/.claude/skills/meta-repo
bash ~/.claude/skills/meta-repo/install.sh
```

The install script symlinks `commands/` into `~/.claude/commands/meta-repo/`, making `/meta-repo:setup`, `/meta-repo:resolve`, and `/meta-repo:govern` available in every Claude Code session.

## Usage

In a folder containing your sub-repos as sub-folders (each with its own `.git/`):

```
/meta-repo:setup
```

The setup command is **idempotent**:
- **Fresh folder** → full scaffold: detects sub-repos, ports, and per-sub-repo dev commands; asks which root package manager to use (`ROOT_PM`, default npm); writes `package.json` (thin bash-alias scripts, run via your root PM), `.gitignore`, the single config file `scripts/lib/workspace.sh`, the mechanism scripts, hooks, the governor scaffold, and seed `tickets.md`/`learnings.md`; wires `.claude/settings.json`; optionally installs + runs doctor.
- **Existing meta-repo** → component-by-component **bump**: detects which capabilities are present (core scripts / worktrees / tickets / governor / hooks) vs missing or outdated and offers to add/upgrade each. All customization lives in `scripts/lib/workspace.sh`, so mechanism scripts refresh from latest templates without clobbering your tweaks.

## What you get

| Command | Purpose |
|---------|---------|
| `npm run dev` | Boot all sub-repos; tee output to `logs/<name>.log` (`-- --only a,b` to scope) |
| `npm run status` | Branch / dirty / ahead / behind / PR# / CI per sub-repo |
| `npm run doctor` | Tooling + env + ports + workspace health audit (+ project `doctor-extra.sh`) |
| `npm run branch -- <name>` / `npm run switch -- <name>` | Cross-sub-repo branch create / checkout |
| `npm run pull` / `npm run push` | ff-only pull / push changed repos + auto-open PRs via `gh` |
| `npm run health` | HTTP liveness check on each dev server |
| `npm run worktree:new\|rm\|status\|exec` | Parallel isolated worktrees (slot registry, port-offset, per-slot bootstrap) |
| `npm run govern` (or `/govern`) | Autonomous ticket loop — headless workers, green-or-none auto-merge, bounded |
| `/meta-repo:resolve <N>` | Disciplined ticket close-out (confirm PR → promote lesson → delete → sweep) |

## The harness (what makes this more than a script bundle)

- **Worktrees** — `worktree:new` allocates a slot (atomic mkdir-locked registry), creates a meta worktree detached at main + sub-repo worktrees on a feature branch, offsets every port by `slot × 10`, and runs an optional per-project bootstrap. `SessionEnd` tears the stack down. Parallel Claude sessions never collide.
- **Ticket queue** — `tickets.md` (numbered, stable-ID work items) + `tickets-parked.md` + `/resolve` + a Stop hook that reconciles tickets at the end of a code-touching session.
- **Governor** — a pure-bash driver dispatches a fresh headless `claude -p` worker per ticket: select → implement-in-worktree → open PR → green-or-none auto-merge (allowlisted repos only) → deterministic bookkeeping. Hard bounds, hard-stop doctrine (park + escalate), progress preservation, supervisor, and observe→propose self-improvement.
- **Hooks** — SessionStart (learnings skim + main-on-main check + optional drift check), Stop (ticket sweep), SessionEnd (worktree cleanup).
- **CLI-first** — external tools are CLIs Claude shells out to (auth once, never prompt mid-run); MCP servers live only in the root `.mcp.json`. Built so a session runs long without asking permission.

## Architecture — one config file

Every mechanism script sources **`scripts/lib/workspace.sh`** — the single generated file holding this workspace's specifics (sub-repo names, dev commands, ports, GitHub org, worktree base, the governor merge allowlist). The mechanism scripts are therefore byte-identical across every install, which is what makes the `/meta-repo:setup` bump safe: it refreshes mechanism scripts from latest templates and only ever (re)writes `workspace.sh` for your customization.

```

## Anti-patterns (load-bearing rules the skill enforces)

1. **MCP servers always at root.** Never `claude mcp add` from a sub-repo.
2. **`cd` into the sub-repo before committing.** `git add` from root won't stage sub-repo files.
3. **Never assume sub-repos share a branch.** They drift. Run `npm run status` first.
4. **Verify which sub-repo you're in before destructive git.**
5. **PRs aren't transactional — merge backend-first.**
6. **`.env.example` is the contract.** Never commit `.env`.
7. **One package manager at the root — never two.** Your choice (`ROOT_PM` = npm/pnpm/yarn/bun); just don't mix two (a stray second root lockfile diverges).
8. **Main checkout stays on `main`; branch work only in worktrees.** Coordination files commit direct to main.
9. **PR opened → tear the local stack down.**
10. **Workers never write `tickets.md`** — the governor's bookkeeper does.

## Status

A small, opinionated skill maintained for personal use. It scaffolds a pattern used in production but isn't a polished open-source product. PRs welcome; expect terse responses.

The templates are a **deliberately-minimal baseline**, not a byte-for-byte mirror of the production harness this skill was extracted from. They track the governor's core loop; several governor-internal hardening refinements (monotonic ticket numbering, tolerant PR-head matching, tolerant worker-report extraction, run-start preflight-main reconcile, run-scoped worker logs) are intentionally omitted until you run a large, long, fleet-concurrent backlog. See **"Baseline vs. the production reference harness (intentional omissions)"** in `SKILL.md` for the full list and rationale.
