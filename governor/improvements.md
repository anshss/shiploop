# Governor improvements

Self-improvement proposals appended by `govern-improve.sh` after a run that hit friction. Each is a
concrete, scoped change to the harness — the operator reviews and applies (or files as a ticket).
Safety rails are never auto-changed; if one caused friction it's flagged `OPERATOR DECISION`.

_(empty — the governor appends here)_

> **AUTO-PROMOTED 2026-07-11 03:55:** 3 safe proposal(s) → ticket **#9**. 0 rail-touching/OPERATOR-DECISION proposal(s) held here behind the human gate (govern-improve-triage.sh, #274).

No `ExitPlanMode` tool is available in this session, so I'll deliver the GOVERN-IMPROVE output directly per its contract (the analysis is saved to the plan file at `/Users/anshs/.claude/plans/govern-improve-you-are-reviewing-radiant-shore.md` for reference).

- `queue/tickets.md`: document `**Depends on:** #K[, #J...]` as a first-class "Optional per-ticket field" (next to the existing `Model:` entry, ~line 22-31) — state that this exact phrase is what `govern::ticket_deps()` (`scripts/govern/lib/common.sh:1095-1116`) parses and what the #119 pre-spawn gate (`run-loop.sh:673-688`) enforces, and that "Ref:"/"siblings"/other prose is not machine-read — why: #7 (commit `49c3c8c`) declared its real blocking prerequisites on #5/#6 as prose siblings only, never the literal phrase, so the gate silently no-op'd and #7 was picked/resolved (shiploop#75) before #5/#6 landed — the exact case the supervisor flagged after the fact. The enforcement already exists; it was just undocumented.
- `scripts/govern/file-ticket.sh`: add a `--depends-on N[,M...]` flag (same pattern as the existing `--model`/`--flow`/`--flow-op` flags, ~line 42-66) that emits a `**Depends on:** #N, #M` line into the filed ticket's leading field block — why: gives a ticket-filer a structured, typo-proof way to declare a blocking prerequisite instead of hand-writing prose that must exactly match `govern::ticket_deps`'s regex, removing the single point of failure that caused #7's ordering miss.
- `scripts/govern/lint-tickets.sh`: add an advisory (WARN-only, non-blocking, exit 0) pass alongside the existing duplicate-heading check that flags when a ticket's body/`Ref:` line names another still-open ticket via relationship language ("sibling", "interface contract", "consumes", etc.) but that number never appears in `govern::ticket_deps`'s parsed output for it — e.g. "#N mentions #K as related but has no `Depends on:` declaration — confirm #K isn't a blocking prerequisite" — why: would have surfaced the #7→#5/#6 mismatch to a human before a worker was ever spawned.

> **AUTO-PROMOTED 2026-07-11 03:56:** 2 safe proposal(s) → ticket **#10**. 0 rail-touching/OPERATOR-DECISION proposal(s) held here behind the human gate (govern-improve-triage.sh, #274).

ExitPlanMode isn't available in this session, so I'll finalize directly with the required output format.

- `scripts/govern/spawn-worker.sh`: add a `GOVERN_FIX_CI` prompt-override block (mirrored on the existing `GOVERN_RESOLVE_CONFLICT` block at spawn-worker.sh:214-236) instructing a CI-fix-redispatch worker that the PR already exists, not to redo the ticket, and to query `gh pr checks`/`gh run view --log-failed` to diagnose the actual CI failure before fixing — currently `GOVERN_FIX_CI` is set by run-loop.sh:275 but never read anywhere in spawn-worker.sh, so the redispatched worker gets the plain first-attempt prompt with no idea CI is red or why, and just re-verifies locally and resubmits (the traced cause of ticket #5's `PR#76(CI-red-left-open)` outcome) — why: this is the direct, code-confirmed root cause, not a one-off worker mistake.
- `scripts/govern/run-loop.sh` (`merge_pr_for_ticket`, ~line 273-276): before each CI-fix redispatch, capture the failing check name(s) via `gh pr checks "$pr" --repo "$(govern::repo_slug "$repo")" --json name,bucket`, then (a) pass them into the worker prompt via a new `GOVERN_FIX_CI_DETAIL` var, and (b) append them to the `"CI-red-left-open"` log line / `pr_summary` so the state note surfaces "which check failed" to the operator without opening GitHub — why: right now neither the redispatched worker nor the operator has any CI-failure detail; both have to dig on GitHub manually.

`GOVERN_CI_FIX_TRIES` (one retry before parking) is a cost/safety bound, not a bug — **OPERATOR DECISION**, not touched.

## 2026-07-11 03:57 — run run-20260711-033248 (resolved/parked/failed observed)

The plan file is written. Since this is a read-only harness-improvement review (not an implementation task), here is the required deliverable directly:

- `scripts/govern/lint-tickets.sh` (+ new `govern::lint_dependency_phrasing` helper in `scripts/govern/lib/common.sh`): flag a ticket whose body references another ticket number alongside dependency language ("sibling", "owned by", "interface contract", "dependency:", "built on", "blocked by") but has no literal `**Depends on:** #N` line — why: tickets #6 and #7 both said they depended on #5 ("OWNED by sibling ticket #5", "DEPENDENCY: ..."), but neither used the phrase `depends on` that `govern::ticket_deps` (`common.sh:1107`) requires, so the existing #119 pre-spawn gate (`run-loop.sh:674-690`, built specifically to prevent this class of problem) never fired and both merged while #5 stayed open.
- `scripts/govern/file-ticket.sh`: add a `--depends-on <N[,N…]>` flag parallel to the existing `--model`/`--flow`/`--flow-op` flags, emitting a normalized `**Depends on:** #N` line — why: the only way to trigger the dependency gate today is to hand-type the exact phrase from memory; a first-class flag makes correct syntax the default, which matters most for LLM-filed tickets (as #5/#6/#7 were).
- `queue/tickets.md` header (near line 13) or `governor/worker-prompt.md`: document the required `**Depends on:** #N` syntax next to the existing "sibling ticket"/"interface contract" filing convention — why: this run's filing template was clearly disciplined but never mentioned the one phrase that's actually machine-read.
- `governor/supervisor-prompt.md` (schema ~line 26-28) + `scripts/govern/escalations-emit-pending.sh` (lines 36-41): add a structured `orderingRisks: [{ticket, blockedOn, note}]` field alongside the free-text `concerns` array, and promote non-empty entries into durable `## Open` items in `governor/escalations.md` — why: this run's supervisor already spotted the exact risk in prose, but it only lives in this run's ephemeral review.md/pending-escalations.json, which the next run's own review.md overwrites — the reconciliation check needed when #5 lands could be silently lost.
- `scripts/govern/lib/common.sh` (`govern::ticket_deps` gate consumed by `run-loop.sh:674-690`): once a dependency is declared, also confirm the dependency's PR actually merged (reuse `govern::pr_state`, already used by `govern::waits_refresh`), not just that the ticket entry was deleted — why: `queue/tickets.md`'s own convention defines "Resolved = PR opened" (not merged), so a correctly-declared dependency could still race an unmerged foundation through a narrower version of the same gap.

None of these touch hard-stops, run bounds, the permission gate, or the merge allowlist — all are additive lints/flags/schema fields that tighten an already-intentional dependency mechanism.
