# Tickets

The work queue. **Work items only** — bugs, gaps, missing capabilities, follow-ups; anything to
fix/build later. NOT a learnings file (transient knowledge → `learnings.md`) and NOT a fixed-bug
writeup (durable lesson → `CLAUDE.md`).

Each ticket is its own numbered `## #N — Title` block. **Numbers are stable IDs while a ticket is
open** — never renumber an open ticket (in-flight PRs/commits reference it). Gaps from
resolved-and-deleted tickets are expected. Numbering is **per-queue**: this file and the parked queue
(`queue/tickets-parked.md`) are each their own serial `## #N` list; a new ticket takes **this file's own
highest `## #N` + 1**.

**Resolved = a fix PR is opened** (not merged). DELETE the entry in the same session the PR opens
(git history + the PR are the record); reference the PR# in the deletion commit. Before deleting,
promote any durable lesson to `CLAUDE.md`. Use `/resolve <N>` to do this the disciplined way.

The governor reads this file: severity-orders the open tickets (High > Medium > Low > unknown), works
the top one, then deletes it on resolve. Keep entries in the shape below so the parser finds them.

### Optional per-ticket fields

- **`Model:`** — pin the model the governor uses for THIS ticket's worker (first attempt only).
  Values: `haiku` (mechanical rename, doc edit, single-file lookup fix) · `sonnet` (standard search
  + edit tickets — the workhorse default when a High-tier isn't warranted) · `opus` (judgment-heavy
  refactors, architectural moves, hard tickets). If absent, the governor uses `GOVERN_WORKER_MODEL`
  (default `opus`). Any retry unconditionally escalates to `GOVERN_WORKER_MODEL` — cheap tier is a
  first-shot bet, never a retry ceiling. Unknown values are ignored (fail-safe). File with
  `scripts/govern/file-ticket.sh --model sonnet "..."`.

## #4 — README landing page never reaches existing workspaces via /shiploop:update

**Severity:** Low
**Model:** sonnet

Where: shiploop/scaffold.sh (component_readme) + shiploop/commands/update.md (Phase 3 bump loop)
Observed: the README landing-page feature (component_readme) only runs under `--component all` or `--component readme`. /shiploop:update Phase 3 bumps only mechanism components (core-scripts worktrees govern githooks commands workflows) + seeds + settings-merge, and README is not in MECH_COMPONENTS (--diff-only drift set). So existing workspaces scaffolded before the feature never gain a root README on update. Also component_readme reads ROOT_PM from $PM (default npm) and repos from --repos, but update passes neither, so an update-generated README would show wrong PM + generic repo list.
Fix direction: (1) component_readme: when --pm/--repos are absent, source scripts/lib/workspace.sh and read ROOT_PM + REPOS for accurate content. (2) update.md Phase 3: add `readme` to the bump loop (safe — component_readme never overwrites an existing README).
Done when: running /shiploop:update in a workspace with no root README creates an accurate `<Project> on Shiploop` README (correct PM + sub-repos); a workspace with an existing README is left untouched; a workspace with no ROOT_PM resolvable still produces a sane default.
Ref: session 2026-07-11 — README feature shipped (commit 9828a35); update-gap surfaced while answering whether /shiploop:update creates a README.

## #9 — Harness self-improvement: promote safe proposals from run-20260711-033250

**Severity:** Low

Where: scripts/govern/* and/or governor/* (per the proposals below).

Observed: govern-improve.sh proposed these SAFE/additive harness improvements after run run-20260711-033250. Auto-promoted from governor/improvements.md by govern-improve-triage.sh (#274) so they are drained like any ticket instead of waiting on a manual promote-remember step (same remember-vs-mechanism class as #271).

Proposals (classified safe/additive — none touches a governor safety rail):
- `queue/tickets.md`: document `**Depends on:** #K[, #J...]` as a first-class "Optional per-ticket field" (next to the existing `Model:` entry, ~line 22-31) — state that this exact phrase is what `govern::ticket_deps()` (`scripts/govern/lib/common.sh:1095-1116`) parses and what the #119 pre-spawn gate (`run-loop.sh:673-688`) enforces, and that "Ref:"/"siblings"/other prose is not machine-read — why: #7 (commit `49c3c8c`) declared its real blocking prerequisites on #5/#6 as prose siblings only, never the literal phrase, so the gate silently no-op'd and #7 was picked/resolved (shiploop#75) before #5/#6 landed — the exact case the supervisor flagged after the fact. The enforcement already exists; it was just undocumented.
- `scripts/govern/file-ticket.sh`: add a `--depends-on N[,M...]` flag (same pattern as the existing `--model`/`--flow`/`--flow-op` flags, ~line 42-66) that emits a `**Depends on:** #N, #M` line into the filed ticket's leading field block — why: gives a ticket-filer a structured, typo-proof way to declare a blocking prerequisite instead of hand-writing prose that must exactly match `govern::ticket_deps`'s regex, removing the single point of failure that caused #7's ordering miss.
- `scripts/govern/lint-tickets.sh`: add an advisory (WARN-only, non-blocking, exit 0) pass alongside the existing duplicate-heading check that flags when a ticket's body/`Ref:` line names another still-open ticket via relationship language ("sibling", "interface contract", "consumes", etc.) but that number never appears in `govern::ticket_deps`'s parsed output for it — e.g. "#N mentions #K as related but has no `Depends on:` declaration — confirm #K isn't a blocking prerequisite" — why: would have surfaced the #7→#5/#6 mismatch to a human before a worker was ever spawned.

Fix direction: implement each proposal above as a normal harness PR (a PR on the meta-repo itself), or explicitly decline it in the PR description if on closer look it is not worth doing.

Done when: each safe proposal above is implemented via a harness PR or explicitly declined.

## #10 — Harness self-improvement: promote safe proposals from run-20260711-033247

**Severity:** Low

Where: scripts/govern/* and/or governor/* (per the proposals below).

Observed: govern-improve.sh proposed these SAFE/additive harness improvements after run run-20260711-033247. Auto-promoted from governor/improvements.md by govern-improve-triage.sh (#274) so they are drained like any ticket instead of waiting on a manual promote-remember step (same remember-vs-mechanism class as #271).

Proposals (classified safe/additive — none touches a governor safety rail):
- `scripts/govern/spawn-worker.sh`: add a `GOVERN_FIX_CI` prompt-override block (mirrored on the existing `GOVERN_RESOLVE_CONFLICT` block at spawn-worker.sh:214-236) instructing a CI-fix-redispatch worker that the PR already exists, not to redo the ticket, and to query `gh pr checks`/`gh run view --log-failed` to diagnose the actual CI failure before fixing — currently `GOVERN_FIX_CI` is set by run-loop.sh:275 but never read anywhere in spawn-worker.sh, so the redispatched worker gets the plain first-attempt prompt with no idea CI is red or why, and just re-verifies locally and resubmits (the traced cause of ticket #5's `PR#76(CI-red-left-open)` outcome) — why: this is the direct, code-confirmed root cause, not a one-off worker mistake.
- `scripts/govern/run-loop.sh` (`merge_pr_for_ticket`, ~line 273-276): before each CI-fix redispatch, capture the failing check name(s) via `gh pr checks "$pr" --repo "$(govern::repo_slug "$repo")" --json name,bucket`, then (a) pass them into the worker prompt via a new `GOVERN_FIX_CI_DETAIL` var, and (b) append them to the `"CI-red-left-open"` log line / `pr_summary` so the state note surfaces "which check failed" to the operator without opening GitHub — why: right now neither the redispatched worker nor the operator has any CI-failure detail; both have to dig on GitHub manually.

Fix direction: implement each proposal above as a normal harness PR (a PR on the meta-repo itself), or explicitly decline it in the PR description if on closer look it is not worth doing.

Done when: each safe proposal above is implemented via a harness PR or explicitly declined.

## #11 — Harness self-improvement: promote safe proposals from run-20260711-033248

**Severity:** Low

Where: scripts/govern/* and/or governor/* (per the proposals below).

Observed: govern-improve.sh proposed these SAFE/additive harness improvements after run run-20260711-033248. Auto-promoted from governor/improvements.md by govern-improve-triage.sh (#274) so they are drained like any ticket instead of waiting on a manual promote-remember step (same remember-vs-mechanism class as #271).

Proposals (classified safe/additive — none touches a governor safety rail):
- `scripts/govern/lint-tickets.sh` (+ new `govern::lint_dependency_phrasing` helper in `scripts/govern/lib/common.sh`): flag a ticket whose body references another ticket number alongside dependency language ("sibling", "owned by", "interface contract", "dependency:", "built on", "blocked by") but has no literal `**Depends on:** #N` line — why: tickets #6 and #7 both said they depended on #5 ("OWNED by sibling ticket #5", "DEPENDENCY: ..."), but neither used the phrase `depends on` that `govern::ticket_deps` (`common.sh:1107`) requires, so the existing #119 pre-spawn gate (`run-loop.sh:674-690`, built specifically to prevent this class of problem) never fired and both merged while #5 stayed open.
- `scripts/govern/file-ticket.sh`: add a `--depends-on <N[,N…]>` flag parallel to the existing `--model`/`--flow`/`--flow-op` flags, emitting a normalized `**Depends on:** #N` line — why: the only way to trigger the dependency gate today is to hand-type the exact phrase from memory; a first-class flag makes correct syntax the default, which matters most for LLM-filed tickets (as #5/#6/#7 were).
- `queue/tickets.md` header (near line 13) or `governor/worker-prompt.md`: document the required `**Depends on:** #N` syntax next to the existing "sibling ticket"/"interface contract" filing convention — why: this run's filing template was clearly disciplined but never mentioned the one phrase that's actually machine-read.
- `governor/supervisor-prompt.md` (schema ~line 26-28) + `scripts/govern/escalations-emit-pending.sh` (lines 36-41): add a structured `orderingRisks: [{ticket, blockedOn, note}]` field alongside the free-text `concerns` array, and promote non-empty entries into durable `## Open` items in `governor/escalations.md` — why: this run's supervisor already spotted the exact risk in prose, but it only lives in this run's ephemeral review.md/pending-escalations.json, which the next run's own review.md overwrites — the reconciliation check needed when #5 lands could be silently lost.
- `scripts/govern/lib/common.sh` (`govern::ticket_deps` gate consumed by `run-loop.sh:674-690`): once a dependency is declared, also confirm the dependency's PR actually merged (reuse `govern::pr_state`, already used by `govern::waits_refresh`), not just that the ticket entry was deleted — why: `queue/tickets.md`'s own convention defines "Resolved = PR opened" (not merged), so a correctly-declared dependency could still race an unmerged foundation through a narrower version of the same gap.

Fix direction: implement each proposal above as a normal harness PR (a PR on the meta-repo itself), or explicitly decline it in the PR description if on closer look it is not worth doing.

Done when: each safe proposal above is implemented via a harness PR or explicitly declined.

## #12 — Harness self-improvement: promote safe proposals from run-20260711-035801

**Severity:** Low

Where: scripts/govern/* and/or governor/* (per the proposals below).

Observed: govern-improve.sh proposed these SAFE/additive harness improvements after run run-20260711-035801. Auto-promoted from governor/improvements.md by govern-improve-triage.sh (#274) so they are drained like any ticket instead of waiting on a manual promote-remember step (same remember-vs-mechanism class as #271).

Proposals (classified safe/additive — none touches a governor safety rail):
- scripts/govern/run-loop.sh: in the `red)` case (~lines 907–913) of the merge-repo PR walk, attach a `.escalation` object to `$report` and set `status="parked"` (not `"failed"`) — exactly like the adjacent `unmergeable)`/`error)`/`external-blocked)` cases — so a PR that's still CI-red after the fix-worker retry gets a real `## Open` entry in `governor/escalations.md` instead of silently landing in `state.jsonl` as `failed` with no escalation. This is what happened to ticket #5 (`shiploop#76` left open on red CI, no escalation filed).
- scripts/govern/run-loop.sh: same fix also closes a second-order bug — the `#60` consecutive-failure circuit breaker (`consecutive_fails`, line ~700) is only checked when `-z "$resumed"`, but a red-CI ticket always has an open PR to resume, so it currently bypasses the circuit breaker entirely and would silently re-dispatch a fresh CI-fix worker on every future run indefinitely. Parking it removes it from selection via the existing escalation-exclusion path, so no separate change to the `resumed` branch is needed.

Fix direction: implement each proposal above as a normal harness PR (a PR on the meta-repo itself), or explicitly decline it in the PR description if on closer look it is not worth doing.

Done when: each safe proposal above is implemented via a harness PR or explicitly declined.

## #13 — Workers verify on macOS while CI runs Linux — inject failing-CI-log excerpts on retry + portability guidance in worker prompt

**Severity:** Medium
**Model:** sonnet

Where: shiploop/ sub-repo — worker prompt assembly (templates/govern/spawn-worker.sh worker instructions) and/or CI docs in templates/seed/CLAUDE.md

Observed: during the v1.9.0 runner build, ticket #5 burned BOTH its governor attempts on a Linux-only CI failure (BSD stat -f %m succeeds-with-garbage on GNU stat, so the worker's macOS-local test run passed while CI failed; the retry worker then fixed an unrelated test issue because it still could not reproduce the failure). Cost: 2 failed outcomes, one manual fix dispatch with a hand-extracted CI diagnosis. The harness gives workers no guidance that CI runs ubuntu while dev machines are macOS, and no nudge to read the failing CI job log before re-verifying locally.

Fix direction: (a) worker prompt gains a portability clause — target env is Linux CI; for bash, prefer GNU-first constructs with BSD fallback (stat/sed/date are the classic splits); (b) on a CI-red retry, the re-dispatched worker's prompt should include the failing job's extracted error lines (gh run view --log-failed | relevant grep) so it fixes the ACTUAL failure instead of guessing from a local run that passes; (c) optionally a lint for known BSD-only flag patterns in templates/.

Done when: worker prompt carries the portability + read-CI-log-first instructions; the CI-red re-dispatch path injects failing-check log excerpts; a note in templates/seed/CLAUDE.md anti-patterns.
