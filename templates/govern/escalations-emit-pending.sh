# #62 — driver→relay hand-off. Scan escalations.md "## Open" and write a machine-readable
# governor/pending-escalations.json listing the entries that STILL need an operator answer
# (Answer field is the `_(operator)_` placeholder). The launching Claude session (the /govern
# relay) reads this file, presents ALL entries in a single batched AskUserQuestion (#89 — ≤4 per
# prompt, chunk if >4, never one prompt per ticket), and writes the chosen Answer +
# Disposition back into escalations.md — closing the write-only gap where parked decisions sat
# unanswered indefinitely. Also fires the configured notification channel (GOVERN_NOTIFY_CMD)
# when pending escalations exist and no session is watching (the driver is headless).
#
# Usage:  escalations-emit-pending.sh [run-id] [review-file]
#   prints the pending count to stdout; writes governor/pending-escalations.json
#   review-file (#92): the run's review.md of supervisor concerns — its non-empty lines are folded
#   into the JSON as `supervisorConcerns` and into the notify message, so the supervisor's advice
#   reaches the relay/operator at run-end instead of dying in review.md.
